# Downeast Cider

## This Project was for my Intro to Web Design Class at Temple University

The was the final project for the course.  

The project description: 

      - Our final project will be to recreate a functioning merchant/e-commerce website built with HTML and styled with CSS. 
      You will model your website from an existing business. Coffee shops are a good example of small businesses that would meet the requirement.
      It needs to be a business that would have a relatively simple product page. Examples of some small independent coffee shops would be La Colombe,
      Ceremony Coffee, Elixr Coffee, Reanimator, Intelligentsia etc. Other people in the past have done small beauty brands (Glossier) or 
      micro-breweries (Yards), but just remember you want to keep it simple! Don't do business that's too big. The site will consist of a homepage 
      and 1 subpage. The homepage will serve as an introduction to the brand and all content will be gathered from the merchantâ€™s website or 
      sources through royalty-free photography and video. The second page will either be a Products page or a Contact Us page, your choice.

I choose Downeast Cider because its one of my favoirte craft ciders out there. Everything about the brand I love, so I wanted to do my take on the brand.
